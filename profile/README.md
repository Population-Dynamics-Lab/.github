# Population Dynamics Lab

The Population Dynamics Lab (PDL) is an open science forum currently hosted at the University of Washingtonâ€™s Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology. This collaborative platform provides researchers, interdisciplinary scholars, and applied demographers a place to share and publish computational methods and empirical tools for population research. PDL is committed to open science, reproducibility, and providing peer-feedback and community engagement in methodological and theoretical advancements in demographic and population research. PDL also aims to increase the visibility and recognition of those innovative methods through attributable and citable DOIs for the research products hosted on the site.
